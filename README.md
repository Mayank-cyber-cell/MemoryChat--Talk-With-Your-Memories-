## 🔖 What is MemoryChat?

MemoryChat is a simple yet powerful web-app that lets you store, revisit and converse with your past memories.  
When you log in, MemoryChat organizes your stored “memory snapshots” and allows you to chat, reflect or walk down nostalgia — giving you a unique way to relive your past.

## 🚀 Features

- Save memory snapshots (text, optional metadata)  
- Chat interface to "talk to" your memories  
- Clean, minimal UI built with modern web stack (TypeScript, CSS, etc.)  
- Easy to deploy and self-host (or use the hosted version)  

## 💡 Why MemoryChat?

In busy lives, we often forget small yet important memories — fleeting moments, small victories, personal thoughts.  
MemoryChat helps you capture those, and provides a safe, private space to revisit them anytime.  
It’s like a “time capsule + chat” — giving memories a second life.
